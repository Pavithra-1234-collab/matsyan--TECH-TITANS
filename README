🐟 SmartFishNet – AI for Smarter Fishing

AI-Powered Real-Time Fish Catch Predictor SmartFishNet is an intelligent, real-time fish catch prediction system designed to assist fishermen in
identifying the best fishing zones.
🎯 **Goal**: Predict fish catch quantity and species in real-time using satellite + oceanographic data (depth, SST, salinity, etc.)

## 🚨 Problem Statement
PROBLEM STATEMENT
Small-scale fishermen often rely on traditional methods to decide where and when to fish, leading to:

🌊 Wasted fuel and time on unproductive trips
🐠 Overfishing in ecologically fragile zones
💸 Unpredictable income and economic insecurity
⛈️ Safety risks during unstable weather
🛰️ Low adoption of modern technology due to cost/accessibility

SmartFishNet solves this by giving **real-time fish predictions** using **ML + ocean science**!
